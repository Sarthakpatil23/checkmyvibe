## checkmyvibe (production readiness & code quality audit)

When the user asks to "check my vibe", run a production readiness check, review
code quality, do a pre-ship sanity check, check for exposed environment variables,
check launch readiness, or asks for a scoped check (`secrets`, `auth`, `db`,
`backend`, `frontend`, `payment`) — use the checkmyvibe skill:

1. Locate its instructions file `SKILL.md` by checking, in order:
   - `.claude/skills/checkmyvibe/SKILL.md`
   - `~/.claude/skills/checkmyvibe/SKILL.md`
   - Search the repo for a `SKILL.md` whose frontmatter contains `name: checkmyvibe`
2. Read it fully and follow every instruction: scope selection, all applicable
   checks, evidence/confidence rules, severity rubric, report format, and final summary.
3. Run helper scripts from the `scripts/` folder next to SKILL.md where the skill
   directs you to (Checks 1–4 and Check 7). They are Python 3: try `python <script> <target>`,
   and if not found retry with `python3`.
4. Save the full detailed audit report to `checkmyvibe-report.md` in the target directory,
   and output the summary and verdict in the conversation response.
5. If no scope is specified, run the full audit (all checks).

Scopes map to checks exactly as defined in SKILL.md's "Scope selection" table:
`secrets` = 1a+1b+2 · `auth` = 3 · `db` = 4 · `backend` = 1a+3+4+5+6(server)+7(server)
· `frontend` = 1b+3(client)+7(client) · `payment` = 7 · full = everything.
